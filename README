This app is developed on Java 17 with Gradle 7.5.1.

To run the application via command line
=======================================
- clone the repo
- run the following command inside the folder
  > ./gradlew run

Expected inputs:
- Line 1: arena limit (eg: 5 5)
- Line 2: position of first robot with direction (eg: 1 2 N)
- Line 3: sequence of moves for first robot (eg: LMLMLMLMM)
- Line 4: position of first robot with direction (eg: 3 3 E)
- Line 5: sequence of moves for second robot (eg: MMRMMRMRRM)

Outputs:
- For valid inputs, 2 lines with the robots new position will be printed to the console
- For invalid inputs, exceptions will be thrown

Assumptions:
- Arena cannot be smaller than 1, 1 (4 grids)
- Two robots cannot occupy the same grid
    - the second robot's initial position cannot be the same as the first robot's final position
    - if the second robot's next move takes it to the first robot's grid, the second robot stops in the grid before
      eg: if first robot is in 2,2 and second robot is in 2, 1 N with the next move M, it remains in 2, 1 N until it turns
- Robots cannot be placed outside the arena limit
- Robots cannot move outside the arena limit
  eg: if a robot is at 0, 0 S and the next move is M, it remains in 0, 0 S
- There will always be exactly 2 robots
- The second robot is placed on the arena after the first robot has completed its movements
